## Cost-of-Living (COL) Definition 

COL estimates are based on the amount of income necessary to pay federal and state income taxes and meet a householdâ€™s basic essential needs. The basic needs include housing, food, transportation, health insurance, childcare, broadband, and other necessities such as clothing and a phone. The COL is a function of family size and composition and where the family resides.

## Assumptions

The full cost of each need, without government subsidies (e.g., public housing, Medicaid, or childcare assistance); or nonprofit or informal assistance from family and friends (e.g., unpaid childcare by a relative, food from food banks, or shared housing).

## Other Estimations

There are several tools to help individuals, communities, and employers determine a local wage rate that allows residents to meet minimum standards of living. These costs-of-living are used to backout the area minimum wage. However, they are not have updated estimates and do not consider the household composition of the geographies.  For example, these are three living wage calculators or monthly costs for tow adults and two children:
