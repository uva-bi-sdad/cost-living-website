## Food Insecurity in the United States

<!-- The USDA Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement (CPS-FSS) food insecurity measure is designed to monitor food insecurity over time at national and state levels. If a food insecurity measure is to inform action and target interventions, it must be constructed for smaller geographic levels and consider differences in the geographic cost-of-living. Moreover, such a model needs to consider incorporating data in all categories: those from statistical/intentional designs (e.g., surveys), administrative data (e.g., government records), opportunity data collections (e.g., social media), and information on procedures and processes (Keller et al., 2020).  -->
